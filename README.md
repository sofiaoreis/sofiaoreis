### Hi there 👽

I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of Lisbon. I perform research in security, software engineering, productivity, program analysis, machine learning, software maintainability and best practices.  

🍵 My projects:
- [Secbench](https://tqrg.github.io/secbench/) - A dataset of 676 security patches (mutli-language, single-commits). 
- [Security Patches Dataset](https://github.com/TQRG/security-patches-dataset) - Collection of datasets for vulnerability prediction -- monthly updated. 
- [SECOM](https://github.com/TQRG/secom) - A convention to structure security commits messages.
- [Lithium-Slicer](https://github.com/sofiaoreis/lithium-slicer) - A test minimization tool to help developers create smaller test inputs (i.e., code snippets) in their bug reports (program slicer based on the Mozilla lithium tool).

✨ Contributions:
- [Infer](https://github.com/facebook/infer/commits?author=sofiaoreis) - I've added models to Meta/Facebook's static analyzer to boost the detection of performance issues in C/C++ (12 weeks internship).
