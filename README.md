### Hi there üëΩ

I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of Lisbon. I perform research in security, software engineering, productivity, program analysis, machine learning, software maintainability and best practices.  

üçµ My projects:
- [Secbench](https://tqrg.github.io/secbench/) - A dataset of 676 security patches (mutli-language, single-commits). 
- [Security Patches Dataset](https://github.com/TQRG/security-patches-dataset) - Collection of datasets for vulnerability prediction -- monthly updated. 
- [SECOM](https://github.com/TQRG/secom) - A convention for security commits messages.
- [Lithium-Slicer](https://github.com/sofiaoreis/lithium-slicer) - A test minimization tool to help developers create smaller test inputs (i.e., code snippets) in their bug reports (program slicer based on the Mozilla lithium tool).
- ... and many more that will soon be published.

üî¨ Research:
- [Maintainable Security](https://github.com/TQRG/maintainable-security) - Fixing Vulnerabilities Potentially Hinders Maintainability. Security engineers should be careful when patching their software vulnerabilities since they might be hindering software maintainability. Paper is available through [Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-021-10019-z) or [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03271).

‚ú® Contributions:
- [Infer](https://github.com/facebook/infer/commits?author=sofiaoreis) - I've added models to Meta/Facebook's static analyzer to boost the detection of performance issues in C/C++ (12 weeks internship).
